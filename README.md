# Milad's dotfiles üê£

My dotfiles to set up macOS/Linux the way I like it.

Powered by [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/) and [Antigen](http://antigen.sharats.me)

## Usage

You can close this repo anywhere. Running the `install.sh` will create a symlink to itself in `~/.dotfiles`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mi-lad/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

## TODO List
- [ ] Do I actually need dotbot?
- [ ] Add a Brewfile
- [ ] Find a way to initialise Vundle plugins See [this](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks)
